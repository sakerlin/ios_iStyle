# iStyle
We believe fashion is not no longer elusive and only for the privileged, when walking on the street we can see so many people are stylish and look sharp. 
this APP would help them to share their design to the world. 

example scenario: 
Marissa Mayer was ever the cover of ELLE, she always has individual idea of fashion and she think she has a duty to make world better and make everyone live in stylish.
She found our APP just like king Arthur found his sword.
